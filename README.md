DISCLAIMER: I'm not expecting anyone to look at this project, or use it, or contribute to it, for
quite a while. I'm using it as a learning exercise more than anything else at the moment, with the
goal of eventually knowing go, electron, node, and so on. I will remove this disclaimer when
I think the project has reached MVP (minimum viable project) stage. That won't be for a while.

The Madness to my Method:

Anyone looking at this (and other of my repos) will see that I've got a lot of little tiny
commits, many of which are hardly more than documentation. I'm trying out something called
the Seinfeld Method, in which the important thing is just to make a daily effort, not
how much you get done in any one day.

Combine that with Dr. B.J.Fogg's method for habit development, which says that tiny
incremental changes are not just OK, but they're a good idea, and you've got a good
explanation of what I'm doing.
