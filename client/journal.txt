-----------------

I'd like to try to do a little test-first development on this project,
but I'm not sure how to begin. I think maybe I should have two top
levels -- one a regular web app, and one an electron app. The regular 
web app could use node/express, perhaps.

I think that might just double the effort and magnify the complexity
though. I'll start by looking at spectron:
