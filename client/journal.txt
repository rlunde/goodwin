I'd like to try to do a little test-first development on this project,
but I'm not sure how to begin. I think maybe I should have two top
levels -- one a regular web app, and one an electron app. The regular 
web app could use node/express, perhaps.

I think that might just double the effort and magnify the complexity
though. I'll start by looking at spectron:

I'm trying to get a simple layout working. I think I'm stuck in my same
old rut, trying to get two divs to line up next to each other, each of
which takes up a fixed percentage of the containing box. 

TODO: add "simple" CSS code generation to what goodwin generates!

Finally got the two divs to line up side by side. Honestly! Why on
earth is that so hard? Most of the stupid StackOverflow questions I found
on it were "closed as duplicates", and most of the remaining ones were wrong.
I think the people who "close as duplicates" without saying duplicates
of *what* are ... well, "jerks" is about the most polite term I can think of.

There's at least one very annoying layout issue remaining, which is that the
inputtext box for the chat interface sticks out into the form div. 

OK, figured that out (needed to add bootstrap classes to the divs and the
textarea), but there are still a few layout things to figure out. I'll add them
to a todo file.
