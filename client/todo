Layout:

[ ] default to a larger window (if can do without extending beyond screen)
[ ] put input box on the bottom of the chatinterface
[ ] make chatinterface and forminterface take up 100% height of enclosing div (why aren't they now?)

Interaction:

[ ] do some reading -- see if I can use react inside electron?
