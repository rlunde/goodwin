[ ] time to give up on this whole "cli" idea, and move back to electron
  [ ] see ../../notes
  [ ] I need a UI with a chat control and a dynamic form to collect info needed to answer a specific question
  [ ] move the stuff from here up a level (e.g. the d3 related stuff)


Former contents of this todo file:

[ ] take another step back? Use of a generator function with "yield" for input processing is over-complicated
  [ ] just do an async event loop with on('line') -- no generator function
  [ ] keep the current state as a hash, not a stack
  [ ] use a function to know what to prompt for
  [ ] use a function to see if what is input is what was prompted for, or something else.
[ ] collect the parameters needed for a bar chart
  [x] prompt for a command
  [x] push the state (STATE_GET_CMD)
  [x] handle list, quit, help
  [ ] handle gen <vis> as described in pseudocode
  [ ] collect location to write sample code
  [ ] collect type of data file (postpone option of using API to get data)
  [ ] version 1: just read from a file, but with a promise in a wrapper function
  [ ] collect colors
  [ ] for number of bars, domain, and range, code should collect min and max values from data (not input)
  [ ] options for labels should be ints or values from another data file?
[ ] write a sample bar chart with index.html that calls it in a directory

// Note: if I need to read a password at some point, use https://github.com/npm/read instead of readline
