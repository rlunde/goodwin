[x] write pseudocode for an initial pass at collecting data and generating code
[ ] collect the parameters needed for a bar chart
  [x] prompt for a command
  [x] push the state (STATE_GET_CMD)
  [ ] handle list, quit, help, or gen <vis> as described in pseudocode
  [ ] collect type of data file (postpone option of using API to get data)
[ ] write a sample bar chart with index.html that calls it in a directory

// Note: if I need to read a password at some point, use https://github.com/npm/read instead of readline

I went to an interesting talk tonight on coroutines and generators (in python), which
may be exactly the kind of thing I need for an event loop like the one I want. I'm
off to see what node.js has along those lines...

Here are some recommended python link:
