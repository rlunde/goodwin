[x] write pseudocode for an initial pass at collecting data and generating code
[ ] collect the parameters needed for a bar chart
  [x] prompt for a command
  [x] push the state (STATE_GET_CMD)
  [x] handle list, quit, help
  [ ] handle gen <vis> as described in pseudocode
  [ ] collect type of data file (postpone option of using API to get data)
  [ ] version 1: just read from a file, but with a promise in a wrapper function
  [ ] collect number of bars
  [ ] collect colors
  [ ] code should collect min and max values from data (not input)
  [ ] options for labels should be ints or values from another data file?
[ ] write a sample bar chart with index.html that calls it in a directory

// Note: if I need to read a password at some point, use https://github.com/npm/read instead of readline

I went to an interesting talk tonight on coroutines and generators (in python), which
may be exactly the kind of thing I need for an event loop like the one I want. I'm
off to see what node.js has along those lines...

Here are some recommended python link:

I looked into the co and co-prompt stuff before, and couldn't understand how to use
them for what I wanted. If I'm feeling incredibly brave (and less sleep deprived) someday,
I may write a version of this that uses them and write about that in a blog. Or not.
