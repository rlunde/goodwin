iI went to an interesting talk on coroutines and generators (in python), which
may be exactly the kind of thing I need for an event loop like the one I want. I'm
off to see what node.js has along those lines...

Here are Erik Swanson's slides from the talk I went to:

Here are some recommended python link:

David Beazley's 3 hour tour of the above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OAlIhXziw

And other python links:

Here are some javascript links:

I looked into the co and co-prompt stuff before, and couldn't understand how to use
them for what I wanted. If I'm feeling incredibly brave (and less sleep deprived) someday,
I may write a version of this that uses them and write about that in a blog. Or not.
