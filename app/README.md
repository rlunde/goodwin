# goodwin
A conversational assistant for software development

Planned Design:

A client-side component developed in node/electron with installation instructions for 
Windows and Unix/Mac. This will allow the client to read and write local files, and 
execute compilers, etc. Obviously, this also increases the need to security and transparency.

A server written (probably) in Rails that provides support for the client,
add-ons, updates, etc.

Initially, the client will do most things as Q&A, with answers stored locally.
