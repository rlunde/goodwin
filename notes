I evaluated using python or ruby to do the CLI version, but
since I want to eventually have an electron-based client, it
made sense to stick with node.

There's a cool article on making a python CLI here, though:

The node article I'm starting with is:

If I move on to a node environment with automatic babel compilation
(which seems like a good thing to try), I might start here:
