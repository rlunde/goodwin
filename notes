It looks like it might be fun to try out electron (http://electron.atom.io) for
building HTML/CSS/JS apps that run as desktop apps and use Node.js. I'd like
the client side to be as interactive as a desktop app, but portable, and 
transparent so the developers who eventually use it can verify that nobody
has snuck evil stuff into it.

The quick start tutorial is:
http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start/
The quick start demo is:

# Clone the Quick Start repository
$ git clone https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start

# Go into the repository
$ cd electron-quick-start

# Install the dependencies and run
$ npm install && npm start

I tried installing electron-prebuilt globally via this:
$ npm install --global electron-prebuilt

But then when I tried to run it I got this error:
$ electron .
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libffmpeg.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/lib/node_modules/electron-prebuilt/dist/Electron.app/Contents/Frameworks/Electron Framework.framework/Versions/A/Electron Framework
    Reason: image not found

I'm trying over with a local node_modules install like that above, and a modified copy of the package.json.

I ended up installing bootstrap and jquery locally too.
To install those yourself:
  cd ./app
  npm install jquery
  npm install bootstrap

I deleted some of my github projects, so I could focus on the most important ones. Github subsequently eliminated
any checkins for those projects from my profile, which is fair. If you can't see what I did, I shouldn't get "credit" for it.

On the other hand, I would have left those projects sitting idle if I'd known they would do that. Oh well. I'll tell
you what, though -- I'm not going to feel guilty about checking in a comment rather than a bunch of code, from now
on. Github gets to reap what it sows, just like everyone else.
