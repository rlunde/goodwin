Here are some ideas for very simple code generation starter projects:
a) generate a very simple web page based on asking a series of questions
b) generate a D3 chart or graph based on conversation
c) generate a model and to/from JSON serialization and a database schema in SQL or NoSQL
d) take a sample of JSON (or yaml) as input, ask questions about each part, and generate a model (etc) as above
e) have a conversation about a simple problem, and choose a sample example that's similar to what you might do
f) generate an iphone / android app based on asking some questions
