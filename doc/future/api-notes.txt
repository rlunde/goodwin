I think the client will build stuff locally, edit code (all by itself -- it's not 
going to be an editor), and that kind of thing. 
Context:

1) what are you doing? (Developing, designing, planning a party, ...)
2) what are the artifacts (e.g. descriptions, files, pseudocode, checklists, 
   requirements, ...) done so far?
3) what is the structure? What are the pieces, and what order 
   (if any) do they need to be done in?
4) what are the open questions?
5) what are the problems to be solved?
6) who is involved?
7) is there are rough schedule?
8) what is the success criteria?

I think the whole thing should be in one or more (docker?) containers. Anything 
that touches a local file should be through a volume, with no access otherwise 
to the users file system.
