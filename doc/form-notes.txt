Form Notes
----------------------------

* remember input for each field of each form across invocations
* try to pre-fill text boxes with sensible defaults whenever possible
* show errors near the field that caused it, or at the top of the form
  if that's hard to figure out. For example, if can't create a directory,
  put the error below the text input for the directory name.
* use a style from a configuration file (colors, fonts, etc.)
* make it easy to report bugs or ideas
* don't overwrite files without confirmation
* (eventually) try to edit files rather than replacing them
