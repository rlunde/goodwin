client: web (html, css, js)
web server: 
  1) serve the client files,
  2) provide all APIs used by client
  3) read/write from mounted volume, and communicate with app server
app server:
  1) all business logic
  2) eventually updated often, and run remotely
  3) initially just another local docker image

My idea is to let the client have full filesystem access, and be
more or less controlled from the server which may be constantly
updated based on work of many people.

Because of the serious security problems with that, I plan to run
both the servers in docker containers, with volumes mounted that
will isolate whatever goodwin does/generates from the host.

People will have to copy generated code (etc.) from the volume
themselves to use it.
