A first sample code generator that might be fun is for D3,
which is amazingly cool and powerful, but not very intuitive.
I looked for people already doing code generation for D3,
and didn't find too much, yet:

http://d3-generator.com/ : a bar chart generator

https://vida.io : d3 templates with a nice UI to help 
   choose and edit them (sign up is required for most things,
   so I don't know how many templates they have or what
   they're like)

One of the things I find most interesting about D3 and other
javascript / SVG graphing tools is the interactivity. If all
you want is a bar chart or a line graph or a pie chart, you
could do that on the server side and be done with it. So the
"data driven documents" part is interesting, but it's not the
fun part. The code that interacts with the user and does
cool graphical stuff in real time is what makes it fun, which
is sometimes hard to figure out how to do in a purely declarative
way.

I'd like the generated code to be complete enough so that
people know how and where to put in functional or procedural
code to make it really fun.
