In the long term, I'd like this project to evolve into a conversational
user interface to a programming environment.

 * not "automatic programming" -- that's been a dream for more than 50 years, and it's likely to remain one
 * use "divide and conquer" in as many ways as possible
   - help to analyze a code base, and refactor code to disentangle and encapsulate what is there
   - help in the design and documentation of a project as well as in coding and testing
   - keep track of TODOs and make it easy to skip over non-essentials without forgetting about them
   - look for ways to use existing open source libraries to solve the current problem
   - look for ways to simplify code to remove dependencies on open source libraries that are overkill
 * the goal is to help the programmer, not to replace the programmer
   - conversational UI should not assume any knowledge from the programmer
   - try to teach / explain as much as anything else
   - don't assume greenfield (new) development - parse and discuss existing code
   - ask questions to determine requirements, and don't overcomplicate (e.g. don't use functional programming for hello world)
   - should be able to pass questions along to real senior developers if automation can't currently handle them
