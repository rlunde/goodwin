Chat UI Notes
--------------------

* inputtext box should be at the bottom, just above footer
* previous input should be in a "talk bubble" on the right side of
  the chat side of the page, intermixed with responses.
* previous responses should be in a "talk bubble" on the left side
  of the chat side of the page, intermixed with input.
* should pick colors, fonts, etc. from a style configuration, with
  a default of a warm color (yellow?) for input and a cool color (blue?)
  for response.
* all the chat bubbles should have a tiny timestamp.
* don't rule out possiblity that multiple parties might be in the
  same chat at some time.
* should be able to scroll up and down in the chat history (including
  previous sessions?)
* position cursor at the end of the text in the inputtext when starting
  or at the end of form submission



Chat Behavior Notes
--------------------

* if user input was a command that requires a form, pop up form elements
* if showing a form and input requires a different form, confirm that (and
  remember any current input)
* when generating a big list of things as a response (as in "what do you
  know"), generate a form with the list, that can be scrolled or selected
  from.
* "remember" what the user is talking about from one input to the next. if
  there are multiple things, try to match the most likely.
* log what people are saying, and ask them if it can be used for training,
  both at the start and at the end.
* intersperse off-beat humor, random facts, etc., but let user say whether
  to stick to business, or say a particular thing is funny or not funny.
