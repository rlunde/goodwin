Here are some ideas for very simple code generation starter projects:
a) generate a very simple web page based on asking a series of questions
b) generate a D3 chart or graph based on conversation
c) generate a model based on conversation, and code to/from JSON 
   serialization and a database schema in SQL or NoSQL
d) take a sample of JSON (or yaml) as input, ask questions about each part, 
   and generate a model (etc) as above
e) have a conversation about a simple problem, and choose a sample example 
   that's similar to what you might do
f) generate an iphone / android app based on asking some questions

I think the most fun first thing to do will be D3. Especially since
the recent release of the latest version of D3 (version 4) has
broken a few of the examples that people find.

The ones I think are the most fun and likely to be interesting for
early users are the bubble chart and the collapsible force layout
(http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/force-collapsible.html).

Realistically, the client should be in node, since that's what
electron is in.

D3's name comes from "data driven documents" so the code generator should also
ask questions about the data model(s) and generate code to read/write data.

Part of asking questions should be (eventually at least) what language and (maybe)
frameworks they are working in, or want to work in, so it can generate at least
a stub project for a client/server app with a service and database in the
desired language and a client in the appropriate framework (e.g. react, or vue).
