I have 3 projects that I want to tie together, and see how
far and how fast I can go. This project (goodwin), and funtodone,
and my new novel (First Rational) which I'm making a deck of cards
and an app to go along with.

The other projects I've got going: writertoys and thing-a-day
are fun projects, but I think they don't necessarily tie in synergistically
with the others.

How does my novel tie in synergistically with goodwin and funtodone? How
do they tie together? I have a lot of ideas about that, but I'm not ready
to commit them to github at this point.
