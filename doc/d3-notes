A first sample code generator that might be fun is for D3,
which is amazingly cool and powerful, but not very intuitive.
I looked for people already doing code generation for D3,
and didn't find too much, yet:

http://d3-generator.com/ : a bar chart generator

https://vida.io : d3 templates with a nice UI to help 
   choose and edit them (sign up is required for most things,
   so I don't know how many templates they have or what
   they're like)
