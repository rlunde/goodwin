technologies to learn and use:

server: go
client: electron / react / node / d3
client infrastructure: docker? vagrant? virtualbox?

My idea is to let the client have full filesystem access, and be
more or less controlled from the server which may be constantly
updated based on work of many people, so the safe way to run
the client is inside a VM of some sort. Of course, then you'd have to 
copy the generated code (etc.) from the VM to your native computer, and
you'd have to trust the stuff you copy, so I will probably just
tell people to use a VM, but guess that many people aren't going
to bother.
