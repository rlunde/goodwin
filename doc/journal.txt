the version history, but for now it's just a distraction for me
and anyone silly enough to look at this.

I've been working on humorscope, thing-a-day, and sideauth over the
past few weeks. 

The trouble with goodwin is a chicken-and-egg thing, I think. It's not
going to get to any MVP state without an enormous amount of work by
a fair number of people, and until it's there it's unlikely to attract
much of any work by almost anyone.

So I think I can't start out trying to make something that's super
helpful in a general way. I need to figure out how to make something
that's useful to the right people to get to the next step, which attracts
another set of people, and so on.

How does the Borg begin? Not that I want this to become the Borg, but
I do want it to get to the point where it's good enough and easy enough
to work on that people want to help improve it and can realistically
get involved.

Maybe what I need to do is write it as a story, to begin with, where
it's years in the future and the only thing standing in the way of
a complete breakdown of society is Goodwin -- and someone is holed
up in a secret hideout, using it to fight for freedom from a neonazi
empire. Or something.

It should be a story and a game, build around github.

I need to think about this.

I've been thinking a bit more about it, and have a silly idea 
that I'm exploring.

Suppose it starts off as a story, but also something like a text 
adventure game. It could involve time travel (Goodwin goes back in 
time to help create itself, kind of like the Director AI in the Travelers
TV show, but not trying to save the world--just trying to help people 
be more productive).

I'm finally back from a 10 day trip, but it's already after 11pm,
so I'm not going to get anything done tonight.

Imagine a combination of:
  a) Travelers
  b) Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
  c) something else?

I think it would start off by cleaning up this project, to simplify
everything, and make a rudimentary text adventure developer's game.

I've been working on other things, and thinking about this without
working on it.

I think it's far too grandiose, and way too abstract, to go anywhere.

I need to trim this back to an initial short story, plus a silly
web toy, and then try to grow it just a little over time. Add a
second story. Make the toy a little more fun, or add a second toy,
etc.

Part of that will just be deleting all this crap for now, so that
it's not going to confuse people into thinking that there's more
to this than there is.
