I think Goodwin isn't a name that will really work for a serious project.

Let's brainstorm some alternatives.

Based on Lever (in the Archimedes sense)?
 * c-lever
 * code-lever
 * p-lever
 * prog-lever
 * cleverage
 * cleverator
 * codelevers
 * codeleverage
 * programmerlever
 * programlever
 * archlever
 * worldlever
 * worldclever
 * cleverworld

Quite a few of those are currently available with various TLDs. Not sure that lever as a metaphor
is really the best, though? Also, there are a million other variants of lever besides those.
