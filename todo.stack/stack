This is an example stack as I imagine it might be represented in funtodone (see
that project) for goodwin.

4: make a capture/replay test framework for command line chat program
4: make an example JSON format D3 sample project description
4: include description in every JSON element (since we can't have comments)
3: make a command line chat program that just creates a skeleton JSON format description
3: make a directory for D3 project sample descriptions (and brainstorm persistence requirements for MVP)
3: make a command line chat that collects info for a D3 sample and outputs JSON description
3: make a D3 code generator that takes a JSON description and produces a D3 example
2: get a D3 conversational code generator working for a limited subset of D3
1: make a first example of client, server, and working demo
1: define what features are critical (vision, docs, code, examples, websites)
0: create a MVP release of goodwin
