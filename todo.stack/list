This is an approximation of an example list as I imagine it might be represented in funtodone (see
that project) for goodwin.

1: look at all the files, and make everything consistent with current ideas
1: keep dividing things up in the stack until there's a task that can be done in 10 minutes
1: keep track of brainstorms for fun targets that will be useful for a lot of people
1: try writing up a long term vision, a medium term goal, and short term tasks
